# Mapping Out the Territory: A Frontend Testing Workshop

* Minute by minute instructions of what to do during the workshop

## Installation Instructions

* Install Node.JS (version 8 or more)
* `git clone`
* Open your favorite editor in the directory created
* If you have Visual Studio Code, you can optionally install the recommended extensions that VS Code suggests
  for a nicer editing experience (it's just ESLint and Prettier Plugins).
  * You will then see eslint errors in the editor, plus you can use `<Cmd/Ctrl>+<Shift>+F` to format the code using
    Prettier
  * Don't worry, even if you don't use the extensions, `npm test` will also run eslint and prettier
